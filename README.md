Slides from my DevRelCon 2021 talk

You'll find a PDF of the talk slides with the speaker notes here in this repository. The actual PPTX is a smidge too large for GitHub it seems. You can also [download the How Humor Helps PowerPoint deck (with speaker notes and alt-tagged images)](https://1drv.ms/u/s!Au3aRt4QOZeQiuUmvw3nSPJp6e3yhA?e=LhOZdo).
